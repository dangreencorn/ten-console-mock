## Software
An assessment of current popular web technologies was made to ensure the viability of porting 
TEN to the new platform and three of the cross-platform candidates for the web-view were 
highlighted for evaluation.

A specification was laid for client-side of the JavaScript frameworks to ensure they are both 
suitable for our application and are maintainable in the long term with sufficient flexibility for a 
robust and scalable API.

A basic outline for the requirements of the server-side interface in relation to system 
administration, user management, access control and storage

### Client Side
### Server Side
### Database 


## Hardware
The preliminary hardware requirements for the thin-client based on our current software plans 
and four varied low-cost small-form-factor boards were evaluated with one selected for further 
evaluation.

The results were quite promising given the recent interest in similar devices used in education 
around the world which has left us with plenty of choice with regards to cost vs. performance, 
however we will hold off on making any purchases until we have conclusive results.
